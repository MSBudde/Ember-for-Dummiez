## Install Ember

You can install Ember with a single command using npm, the Node.js package manager. Type this into your terminal:

1
npm install -g ember-cli@2.5

## Create a New Application

Once you've installed Ember CLI via npm, you will have access to a new ember command in your terminal. You can use the ember new command to create a new application.

1
ember new ember-quickstart
This one command will create a new directory called ember-quickstart and set up a new Ember application inside of it. Out of the box, your application will include:

A development server.
Template compilation.
JavaScript and CSS minification.
ES2015 features via Babel.
By providing everything you need to build production-ready web applications in an integrated package, Ember makes starting new projects a breeze.
